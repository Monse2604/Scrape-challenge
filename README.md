Mars Data Scraping Challenge - Solution
This repository contains the solution to the Mars Data Scraping Challenge, split into two main parts: scraping and analyzing data from Mars news articles and Mars weather data.

Files Included
Solution_part_1_mars_news.ipynb

A Jupyter Notebook containing the solution for Part 1: Scraping Titles and Preview Text from Mars News.
This file demonstrates the use of Splinter and BeautifulSoup to scrape Mars news articles, including their titles and preview text.
The scraped data is stored as a JSON file.
mars_news.json

A JSON file containing the scraped titles and preview text of Mars news articles.
This file serves as a sample of the data extracted in Part 1 for further use or validation.
Solution_part_2_mars_weather.ipynb

A Jupyter Notebook containing the solution for Part 2: Scraping and Analyzing Mars Weather Data.
The notebook includes the scraping of Mars weather data, conversion to a DataFrame, and analysis with Pandas.
Several graphs are generated to visualize temperature and atmospheric pressure trends on Mars, including identifying seasonal patterns.
mars_weather_data.csv

A CSV file containing the cleaned and analyzed Mars weather data extracted from the web.
This file is generated as part of the output from Part 2.
How to Use These Files
View the Notebooks (.ipynb files):

Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or any compatible IDE to explore the code and results.
Access the Data Files (.json and .csv):

Use the JSON and CSV files to view the scraped and processed data.
The JSON file is from Part 1 (Mars news), and the CSV file is from Part 2 (Mars weather).
Graphs and Insights:

Both notebooks include detailed visualizations to demonstrate insights derived from the scraped data.
Summary
This project showcases the use of Python for:

Automated web scraping with Splinter and BeautifulSoup.
Data cleaning and analysis with Pandas.
Data visualization with Matplotlib.
These files collectively represent the complete solution for the Mars Data Scraping Challenge.
